# simple-clock-js
This is the simple clock js created with canvas and date.

I wrote this code in VSCode, and I start server using Live Server extension. It will be also easy to run in localhost.

## After installation Live Server
You just have too in the 'index.html' right-click and chose 'Open with Live Server' it will automatically open you the project in localhost.

Enjoy :)
